# How pricing works: crowd-priced outcome pools
EveryX does not use a traditional order book with bids and asks.
Every Event has pools for each Outcome where user trades go.
The probability shown on the screen is derived from how much money is in that outcome's pool relative to the others.
Very simply:
Probability of Outcome A ≈
(Money in Pool A) ÷ (Money in Pool A + Pool B + Pool C + …)
As more money flows into an Outcome:
Its probability goes up,
The probabilities of other Outcomes go down.
This means:
You are effectively trading against the entire crowd, not a privileged market maker with deep pockets.
Events can function without a 1:1 buyer and seller for every trade at the exact moment of entry.
