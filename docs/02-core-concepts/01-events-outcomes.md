# Events and Outcomes

## What is an Event?
An Event is a real-world question that will eventually have a clear answer, for example:
"Bitcoin to close above $100,000 on 31 Dec 2025?"
"Team A to win the championship?"
"Tokyo to experience an earthquake above X magnitude this year?"
Each Event has:
A start time (when trading opens),
An end time (when trading closes),
A resolution time (when the outcome is known and payouts are made).

## Outcomes
Each Event offers two or more Outcomes, for example:
- YES / NO
- Team A / Team B / Draw
- Multiple time bands (e.g. "In March", "In April", etc.)
Outcomes are designed to be:
- Clear
- Mutually exclusive (only one can be correct)
- Collectively exhaustive (one of them must happen)
Users trade on which Outcome they think will be correct.
