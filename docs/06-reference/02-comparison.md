# Why EveryX? (positioning vs. other platforms)

## No market makers
On traditional order-book platforms, users mostly trade against professional market makers who often have:
more information,
faster systems,
and incentives to profit from small edge cases.
On EveryX:
All trades go into each Event's outcome pools.
Probabilities are set by everyone's money combined, not by a special desk on the other side of your trade.
You trade against the crowd, not a privileged counterparty.

## Always-on liquidity for events
Because we use Event pools:
Events do not require a perfect match between buyers and sellers at the exact moment of each trade.
Money can flow into one side first (e.g. "YES"), and the other side can arrive later.
This allows EveryX to:
Run Events that would be hard to support with a traditional order book, and
Offer leverage even when an Event is small or niche.

## Simple, probability-first UX
EveryX hides most of the trading machinery and keeps the user focused on:
Probability,
How much to risk,
Where to place the stop-loss.
There is no need to understand:
order books,
maker/taker fee tables,
or complicated derivatives jargon.
This makes EveryX easier to explain to:
KOLs and partners,
non-expert users,
and communities who are used to thinking in chances and outcomes, not candlesticks.

## Clear economics
EveryX focuses on a single, transparent platform fee taken from the losing side, rather than multiple overlapping fees. There are:
No interest charges on leverage,
No hidden funding rates,
No complex fee ladders.
