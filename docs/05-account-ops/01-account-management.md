# Accounts, deposits, and withdrawals (high-level)

## Accounts
Opening an account on EveryX is straightforward and can be done with an email or wallet address.
Some features (like higher withdrawal limits) may require additional verification and/or fulfilling KYC requirements.

## Deposits
Users can deposit using supported methods (e.g. cryptocurrency, credit card, bank transfer; exact options depend on region, verification level, and current integrations).
Deposits typically appear in moments, after network confirmation.

## Withdrawals
Withdrawals are processed regularly, usually within a defined time window (e.g. within 24 hours).
Maximum withdrawal amounts depend on the user's VIP level.
At present, EveryX does not require excessive documentation for standard withdrawals, but policies may depend on your jurisdiction, perceived risk level, or other factors.
There is a $1 fee on all withdrawals to cover network costs.
