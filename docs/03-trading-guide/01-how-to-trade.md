# How it Works

## Choose Your Market
Interested in pop-culture? Crypto prices? Want to insure your vacation against hurricane risk? Browse our categories or perform advanced searches on keywords and tags and find the Events that suit you. 

## Make Your Prediction
Choose the outcome that looks best for you. Maybe you want to get paid if a hurricane makes landfall in Florida in September, the month of your big trip to Miami? 

## Set-up Your Trade
Select the size of your trade, add up to 10x leverage if you like, confirm you're comfortable with your risk level, and hit the Buy button. Congratulations, you just made your first trade!

# Placing a trade
When a user trades on EveryX, they decide three main things:
Which Event and Outcome they want to trade.
Trade size (how much cash to risk).
Leverage and stop-loss level (how aggressively to amplify the position, and where to cut losses).
The interface focuses on probability, not prices:
Users see the current probability (%) of each Outcome.
They choose how much to risk and whether to use leverage.
They set a stop-loss probability for their position.
When the Event resolves:
If the user picked the correct Outcome, they receive a payout from the losers.
If the user picked the wrong Outcome, they lose the cash portion they put at risk (or less, if they closed early).
