# Our Vision

## Time for EveryX to Shine
EveryX is built on the belief that markets can do more than trade stocks and coins. They can become a practical tool for insight – a way for communities, organizations, and individuals to see, in one number, what the crowd really thinks will happen. That's the core idea behind a prediction market.

Prediction markets should:
- Inform business and policy decisions
- Guide how capital and attention are allocated
- Help groups coordinate around reality instead of noise

Today, they mostly don't. They're still niche tools, used by a small group of specialists and hobbyists.

Our goal is simple:
Move prediction markets from curiosity to everyday infrastructure.
