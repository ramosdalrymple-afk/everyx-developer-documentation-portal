# Why We Built EveryX

EveryX started from a simple question:
If lots of people each know a little bit, how do we turn that into one good prediction?

In real life, many different people hold pieces of information about the future — about elections, sports, crypto, inflation, technology and more.

No one sees everything, but together they often know a lot.
A prediction market is a way to collect that knowledge:
Instead of filling in a survey, people put money behind what they think will happen.
If they think an outcome is too cheap, they buy it.
If they think it's too expensive, they avoid it or trade the other side.
When lots of people do this, the probability on the screen becomes a crowd forecast.

## What Makes EveryX Different
EveryX takes this idea and makes it practical and accessible:
- Clear probabilities
We show simple, easy-to-read probabilities instead of confusing share prices, so anyone can quickly see "what the market thinks".
- Leverage with a clear maximum loss
Users can use leverage so that strong opinions matter even with small stakes – while always knowing the most they can lose.
- Advanced pool-based algorithms
We use advanced algorithms to manage the investment pools, so events can stay tradable even when there aren't many buyers and sellers at the same moment.

Put together, EveryX:
Uses a probability-first design so anyone can understand what they're seeing, then adds built-in leverage so capital can work harder, on top of a robust, barrier-free execution agent. The result- greater returns without complexity. 
EveryX turns what many people know into live probabilities that anyone can see and trade on.

# Opportunity Knocks
Prediction markets are getting more attention than ever, but they still haven't become everyday infrastructure. Across most platforms, the same four problems keep showing up:
- Liquidity
Outside a few big events (like US elections), markets are often thin and easy to move.
A single mid-sized order can swing displayed probabilities by a large amount, making prices unreliable.
Many platforms struggle to keep users coming back, so markets "die" after the first wave of trades.
- Capital Inefficiency
On most platforms, users lock funds until resolution – which can take months or years.
Payouts are capped between 0 and 1 with no built-in leverage, so capital works slowly.
Users can't easily spread the same capital across multiple outcomes and events; money sits idle.
- Poor User Experience
Platforms decide most of what you can trade on, and often keep 100% of fees.
Interfaces are built around order books and trading jargon that many people don't understand.
There's usually no meaningful engagement loop beyond placing a single trade.
- Expert Exodus
The people with the best information (domain experts, analysts, niche community leaders) often don't participate.
Markets feel illiquid or "rigged" by professional market makers.
Returns are too low for the effort, and there's no way to build a visible track record of skill.
Result:
Prediction markets remain a curiosity instead of a standard tool for decision-making and insight.
