# Event lifecycle
Each Event moves through a few clear stages:
- Upcoming – Event is created, trading opens at a scheduled time.
- Live – Trading is open, users can enter or adjust trades.
- Closed – Trading stops before the real-world outcome is known (for example, at the start of a match or at a cutoff time).
- Pending Resolution – The Event is closed, and EveryX is collecting the final information needed to decide the correct Outcome.
- Resolved – The correct Outcome is confirmed, payouts are distributed.
- Inactive – Event is frozen or cancelled due to external issues (e.g. data problems, ambiguity, or other unexpected events).
If an Event is cancelled or cannot be fairly resolved, EveryX has policies to return funds to users. Please refer to the detailed, event-specific Rules when trading.
