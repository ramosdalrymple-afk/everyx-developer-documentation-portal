# Payouts and fees

## How payouts work
After an Event Closed, resolution criteria are checked and confirmed. Once a Resolution event has occurred:
The correct Outcome is identified.
All trades on that Outcome share in the losing pools.
The payout is based on:
how much money was in each Outcome's pool, 
how big each user's position was in the winning Outcome, and
how early they got involved in the outcome
Users see final results in their account as profit or loss.
