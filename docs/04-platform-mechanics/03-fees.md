# Payouts and fees

## What are the fees?
EveryX charges a small platform fee from the losing side in each Event.
Key points:
Fees are taken from the losers.
There are no deposit fees from EveryX.
No interest on leveraged positions.
No complex maker/taker fees or funding rates.
The fee structure is intentionally simple so that KOLs, partners, and users can easily understand how the platform earns money and what users can expect to receive when they win.
